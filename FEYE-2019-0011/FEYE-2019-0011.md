# FEYE-2019-0011
## Description
Harris Ormed Self Service through 2019-10-30 allows an authenticated user to view W-2 forms belonging to other users via an arbitrary empNo value to the ORMEDMIS/Data/PY/T4W2Service.svc/RetrieveW2EntriesForEmployee URI, thus exposing sensitive information including employee tax information, social security numbers, home addresses, and more.


## Impact
High - Sensitive information leakage

## Exploitability
High - Vulnerability is pre-auth

## CVE Reference
CVE-2019-18626

## Technical Details
The ORMEDMIS/Data/PY/T4W2Service.svc/RetrieveW2EntriesForEmployee URI receives a JSON request and responds with W-2 information for the specified employee. The employee is specified in the JSON request with the empNo integer parameter, and the application does not restrict which employee W-2 information a user may request. By sending many requests which iterate over possible empNo values, an authenticated attacker can extract W-2 information associated with all users of the application.

## Resolution
This issue is resolved in patch 2019.1.4 in November 2019
