# FEYE-2019-000
## Description
IOCTL 0xC3502580 in gdrv.sys, which is packaged as part of multiple applications, exposes the wrmsr instruction to user-mode callers without properly validating the target Model Specific Register (MSR). This can result in arbitrary unsigned code being executed in Ring 0.

## Impact
High - Arbitrary Ring 0 code execution

## Exploitability
Medium/Low - Driver must be loaded or attacker will require admin rights. Newer versions require admin callers.

## CVE Reference
CVE-2019-7630

## Technical Details
IOCTL 0xC3502580 in the gdrv.sys driver, included as part of the Gigabyte App center, instructs the binary to modify a Model Specific Register (MSR) on the target system. These registers control a wide variety of system functionality and can be used to monitor CPU temperate, track branches in code, tweak voltages, etc. MSRs are also responsible for setting the kernelmode function responsible for handling system calls.

The GPU-Z driver does not appropriately filter access to MSRs, allowing an attacker to overwrite the system call handler and run unsigned code in Ring 0. Allowing access to any of the following MSRs can result in arbitrary Ring 0 code being executed:

* 0xC0000081
* 0xC0000082
* 0xC0000083
* 0x174
* 0x175
* 0x176

For exploitation details see the INFILTRATE presentation in the references.

## Resolution
This issue was fixed in version 19.0227.1 in May 2019

This issue is fixed in v2.23.0: [https://www.techpowerup.com/257995/techpowerup-releases-gpu-z-v2-23-0](https://www.techpowerup.com/257995/techpowerup-releases-gpu-z-v2-23-0)
