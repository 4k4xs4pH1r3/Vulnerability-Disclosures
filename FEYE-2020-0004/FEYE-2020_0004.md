# FEYE-2020-0004

## Description
AlienForm v2.0.2 CGI script is vulnerable to remote code execution leading to server compromise by attackers. This vulnerability could be a derivative or unexplored area of CVE-2002-0934.

## Impact
High - Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in the attacker remotely executing code on the affected systems. Remote code execution could lead to complete system compromise and the ability to gain access to user credentials and/or move laterally throughout the compromised environment.

## Exploitability
