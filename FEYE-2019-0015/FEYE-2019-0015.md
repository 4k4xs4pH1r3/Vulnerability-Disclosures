# FEYE-2019-0015
## Description
IOCTL 0x9C40256C in aillk64.sys, included as part of the ATI Diagnostics Hardware Abstraction utility, exposes the wrmsr instruction to user-mode callers without properly validating the target Model Specific Register (MSR). This can result in arbitrary unsigned code being executed in Ring 0.

## Impact
High - Arbitrary Ring 0 code execution

## Exploitability
Low/Medium - Driver must be loaded or attacker will require admin rights.

## CVE Reference
CVE-2019-7246

## Technical Details
IOCTL 0x9C40256C in aillk64.sys, included as part of the ATI Diagnostics Hardware Abstraction utility, exposes the wrmsr instruction to user-mode callers without properly validating the target Model Specific Register (MSR). This can result in arbitrary unsigned code being executed in Ring 0.

The driver does not appropriately filter access to MSRs, allowing an attacker to overwrite the system call handler and run unsigned code in Ring 0. Allowing access to any of the following MSRs can result in arbitrary Ring 0 code being executed:

* 0xC0000081
* 0xC0000082
* 0xC0000083
* 0x174
* 0x175
* 0x176

For exploitation details see the INFILTRATE presentation in the references.

## Resolution
Per the vendor, this issue is being disclosed due to the software package being discontinued.
