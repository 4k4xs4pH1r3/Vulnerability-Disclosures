# FEYE-2019-0001
## Description
VMWare Workstation and Fusion before versions 15.5 and 11.5 improperly handled malformed IPv6 packets, leading to a denial of service for the networking services on all VMs on that host.

## Impact
Medium - DOS for networking functionality for all VMs on the same host

## Exploitability
Low - An attacker only needs to send an IPv6 packet

## CVE Reference
CVE-2019-5535

## Technical Details
When sending an IPv6 packet, the VMNAT service in vulnerable versions of vmware will improperly parse the packet. If the attacker provided an value of zero for the MTU, VMNAT will enter an infinite loop attempting to process the packet. Because of the architecture of this process, this infinite loop stops legitimate traffic from the malicious and other VMs from being processed, leading to a denial of service.

## Resolution
This issue was fixed as part of VMSA-2019-0014
